# Boson star with angular momentum

This is the data corresponding to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05690 and
plotting scripts used to generate the figures.  The data contains gravitational
weyl scalar
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?{\color{White}&space;r\Psi_4}),
as well as the other data extracted from our simulations.

## Data from simulations

We share in this git repo the part of the data produced in our simulations. The
four folders contains the same merger of two boson stars  described in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05690 with four different resolutions. The name of the
folder is the number of grid points used for the coarsest outermost grid.  For
example, the file ["~/320/Weyl4_mode_20.dat"](320/Weyl4_mode_20.dat) contains
the Weyl scalar
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?{\color{White}&space;r\Psi_4})
decomposed using spinweighted spherical harmonics with spin-weight s = -2 and l =
2 m = 0 extracted at several radii. All even columns provide the real part for
a given radius and the uneven the imaginary part. If in doubt, the header
provides the necessary data of what column contains what data.
